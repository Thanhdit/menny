This repository contains the code and instructions to create HDEEs described in the paper titled "HDEE: Heterogeneous Domain Expert Ensemble".

HDEE is a framework for creating Diverse Expert Ensembles, i.e. heterogeneous training of mixture-of-experts models in a parallel fashion. It shows that introducing heterogeneity into the training process yields a better-performing ensemble. Specifically, instead of training all experts with identical configurations, HDEE tailors each expert based on its data domain. For simpler domains, a smaller model (or one trained with fewer iterations) is used; for more challenging domains, larger models and extended training are applied.

Requirements
Run the following commands to obtain the required packages:

python -m pip install pdm
python -m pdm init 
python -m pdm install
In case of receiving an error regarding flash attention, run pdm run pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation.

Running Experiments
To run an example HDEE setting given in the paper, follow the instructions given below.

The training run details are captured by hydra configs that are stored in the /configs folder.

The example scripts can be found in /scripts folder.

The experimental results are store in /experiments folder.

Loading Datasets
To load datasets, make sure to replace <TOKEN_NAME> and <TOKEN> with your own HF token in the corresponding scripts.

To load and pretokenize OpenWebText dataset used to train the seed models, run the following script:

./scripts/load_openwebtext.sh
To load and pretokenize M2D2 trained domains, run script with:

./scripts/load_trained_M2D2_domains.sh
To load and pretokenize other trained domains, run script with:

./scripts/load_trained_other_domains.sh
Split each dataset into train, validation and test folders, if necessary. In other words, if these splits do not exist in the loaded HF dataset by default, then they can be split by the ratio 80-10-10. For example, OpenWebText dataset has a single split downloaded into /dataset/openwebtext/raw/ folder, which should be split into train, validation and test folders under /dataset/openwebtext/ wrt the split ratio.

Training Seed Models
To train the seed models, run script with:

./scripts/train_seed_models.sh
This script will train three seed models wrt the model sizes of Small (Close) case (90M, 115M, 135M) described in the paper. To train different model sizes, update the config parameters of each expert given in /configs/hdee_seed_models.

Training Heterogeneous Domain Experts
To train three iterations of the ensembles described in the paper, run script with:

./scripts/train_domain_experts.sh
This script will train three iteration of HDEEs wrt the domains given in the paper. At each iteration, three new domains will be trained over the latest (corresponding) experts. To train with different domains, download the corresponding datasets into /datasets folder and add their paths into /config/hdee_3_iterations/train_domains folder.

Evaluating Ensembles
To evaluate the final iterations of the ensembles, run script with:

./scripts/evaluate_ensembles.sh
This script will evaluate three ensembles: (i) 
M

 (baseline): homogeneous model sizes and an equal number of steps for all models, (ii)
